Welcome to my Eda of the Titanic datase
In this task I imported the Titanic dataset as a dataframe.
First I cleaned it then genarated a heat mata of the data.
I then plotted various graphs to exore the dataset.
I then came to various conclusions about the likely survial rate of various passengers aboard the titanic.
learning thiS aspect of coding is important because in order to run visulisations you need to make sure that the dataframes are clean in order to beable to get a clear picture of what the data is telling us.
